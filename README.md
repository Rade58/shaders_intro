# Shaders - Intro project

## Vertex shader will be used **to position each vertex** of the geometry

1. Vertex shader(a special program) we create, as an instruction will be sent to GPU
2. We send mentioned vertex shader together with data like:
   - vertices coordinates
   - mesh transformations
   - cammera informations
  
  and GPU will follow instruction and position the vertices

IMORTANT: `Vertex Shader program will be run for every point`

Most simple thing that can be drown is a triangle
